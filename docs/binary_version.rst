Downloading the Binary Version
==============================

Please, access the release page `here`_ and check the version that you would like to use.

If for any reason the binary didn't run properly in your machine also with python3.6, as below example, probably you are using a bit old version of 3.6. In this case, you can create the virtual environment following the steps below, and generate a new binary file that will be 100% compatible with your current python version.
