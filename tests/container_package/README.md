# Generate the binary

Feel free to execute this script on any rhel/linxu that you are testing crhc-cli, this will create 2 containers

 - The first one with the python version 3.8
 - The second one which will create a binary file based on the latest version of crhc-cli code, and this will be compatible with rhel7/8 or glibc of rhel7/8


Just execute the script and it will be enough to prepare everything. Note that you will be notified about removing any image that you have, assuming this is not a big deal, the script will proceed and do all the necessary steps.
